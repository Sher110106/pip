# GitHub Integration Demo

This demo shows how the Python Dependency Resolver integrates with GitHub to provide automated dependency analysis.

## Example Pull Request Flow

### 1. Developer Creates PR with Dependencies

```bash
# Developer adds new requirements
echo "django>=4.0.0" >> requirements.txt
echo "requests>=2.28.0" >> requirements.txt
echo "celery>=5.2.0" >> requirements.txt
echo "gunicorn>=20.1.0" >> requirements.txt

git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Add Django and API dependencies"
git push origin feature/new-api
```

### 2. Automatic Analysis Triggered

The GitHub App automatically detects the `requirements.txt` changes and triggers analysis:

```
üîç Analyzing requirements.txt changes...
üì¶ Found 4 new packages to analyze
‚öôÔ∏è  Starting dependency resolution for Python 3.9
```

### 3. AI-Powered Analysis Results

The system posts a detailed comment on the PR:

---

### 4. GitHub Status Check

The integration also creates a GitHub status check:

```
‚úÖ Python Dependency Analysis
‚ö†Ô∏è 1 deprecated package found
Found 1 deprecated package. Consider updating to recommended alternatives.
```

### 5. CI/CD Integration

If you have GitHub Actions enabled, the workflow runs and creates detailed reports:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions Summary
‚úÖ Dependencies analyzed successfully
‚ö†Ô∏è 1 deprecated package requires attention
üìã Full report available in artifacts
```

## Advanced Features Demo

### Conflict Detection

When the system detects version conflicts:

```python
# requirements.txt with conflicts
Django>=4.0.0
django-rest-framework>=3.14.0  # Requires Django>=3.2,<4.0
```

**Analysis Result:**

---

## üîç Dependency Analysis for `requirements.txt`

‚ùå **Version conflicts detected**

### ‚ùå Version Conflicts (1)

#### Django, django-rest-framework
**Issue**: django-rest-framework 3.14.0 requires Django>=3.2,<4.0 but Django>=4.0.0 was specified
**üí° Resolution**: Upgrade to django-rest-framework>=3.15.0 for Django 4.x compatibility

---

### Security-Focused Analysis

The system also identifies security-related issues:

```python
# requirements.txt with security issues
requests==2.25.1  # Has known vulnerabilities
Pillow==8.0.0     # Outdated version with security issues
```

**Analysis Result:**

---

## üîç Dependency Analysis for `requirements.txt`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security concerns detected**

### üîí Security Warnings

#### requests v2.25.1
**Issue**: Known vulnerability CVE-2023-32681
**üí° Resolution**: Update to `requests>=2.31.0`

#### Pillow v8.0.0
**Issue**: Multiple security vulnerabilities in image processing
**üí° Resolution**: Update to `Pillow>=10.0.0`

## Example Workflows

### Team Development Workflow

1. **Feature Development**
   ```bash
   # Developer working on new feature
   git checkout -b feature/payment-integration
   echo "stripe>=5.4.0" >> requirements.txt
   git commit -am "Add Stripe payment integration"
   git push origin feature/payment-integration
   ```

2. **Automated Review**
   - GitHub App analyzes the dependency
   - Comments on compatibility with existing packages
   - Checks for security issues and deprecation status

3. **Team Review**
   ```markdown
   ## Code Review Comments
   
   @developer123: The Stripe integration looks good! 
   
   ü§ñ **Dependency Analysis**: ‚úÖ No conflicts found. Stripe 5.4.0 is compatible with your Django setup.
   ```

4. **Merge with Confidence**
   - No conflicts detected
   - All dependencies are current and secure
   - Merge approved

### Maintenance Workflow
